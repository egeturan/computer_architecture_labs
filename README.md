# Computer_architecture_labs
Brief explanations of the labs
1. Some MIPS assemly calculations.
2. MIPS array sorting and some array transactions.
3. LinkedList implementation using MIPS assembly language.
4. System Verilog model of single-cycle MIPS by designing a 32-bit ALU module. Implemented and make some modification described in describtion file.
5. Pipelined MIPS processor using the digital design engineering tools (System Verilog HDL, Xilinx Vivado and FPGA, Digilent BASYS3 development board). Implemented using verilog and demonstrated on the BASYS3 board.
6. Caching Simulation using MIPS assembly
7. MicroC program for microcontroller PIC32MX795F512L.
